Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in
literature, but it was he who superimposed his secular vision of the
holiday upon the public. The forces that impelled Dickens to create
a powerful, impressive, and enduring tale were the profoundly
humiliating experiences of his childhood, the plight of the poor and
their children during the boom decades of the 1830s and 1840s,
Washington Irving's essays on Christmas published in his Sketch Book
(1820) describing the traditional old English Christmas, fairy
tales and nursery stories, as well as satirical essays and religious
tracts.
